Lo calized Temp oral Reasoning A StateBased Approach ShieuHong LinandThomas Dean Department of Computer Science Brown UniversityProvidence RI  Abstract We are concerned with temp oral reasoning problems where there is uncertaintyabout the order in whichevents o ccur The task of temp oral reasoning is to deriveanevent sequence consistent with a given set of or dering constraints immediately following which one or more conditions havespec ied statusesPrevious researchshows that the asso ciated decision problems are hard even for very restricted casesIn this pap er we present a framework of lo calized temp oral reasoning which use sub goals and abstraction to exploit structure in temp oral ordering and causal interac tionWeinvestigate  lo cality regard ing ordering constraints that group events hierarchically into sets calledregionsand 	 lo cality regarding causal interactions among regions whichischaracterized by subsets of the set of conditions The com plexity for an instance of temp oral reason ing is quantied by the sizes of the charac teristic subsets of conditions and the num b ers of child regions of individual regions in the region hierarchy This demonstrates the p otential for substantial improvements
in p erformance Intro duction We are interested in reasoning ab out a dynamical sys tem whose state is mo deled by a set of conditionsP Each condition has a status true or false at a given p oint in time and theevolution of the systemcorre sp onds to a sequence of state changes The evolution of the system dep ends on the interactions among a set of eventsEAneventeinEchanges the system state according to a set ofcausal rulesasso ciated withe A rule asso ciated with an eventeis a STRIPSlike op erator describing the causal e
ects ofewhen the preconditions of the rule are satised In this way eachevent sp ecies a statetransition function on the state space determined byP The ordering of the events is uncertain The p ossible event sequences are determined by a given set of ordering constraints on
the events Generallymanyevent orderings are p os sible eachofwhichmay result in a di
erentevolution of the systemGiven the initial state and a set of goal conditions G the task oftemporal reachability is to  de tect the existence of a p ossible event sequence im mediately follo
wing which the conditions inGhave sp ecied statuses and 	 generate one suchevent sequence if one existsIn other words the task of temp oral reachability is to predict the p ossibilityof reaching the goal states where the conditions inG have the sp ecied statuses and rep ort one p ossible event sequence which ends in the goal states For ex ample consider a partial plan where the ordering of the comp onents is constrained by some partial order Using temp oral reachabilitywe can co ordinate the comp onentevents to reach the goal states in a way consistent with the inherent ordering constraints On the other hand we can also apply temp oral reacha bilitytovalidate the partial plan by  sp ecifying the undesirable states as goal states where the set of goal conditions have the sp ecied statuses 	 detect ing the p ossibility of reaching undesirable states and  rep orting such a p ossible event sequence as evi dence This research extends the earlier work of Dean and Bo ddy  on reasoning ab out partially ordered events In sp ecial cases temp oral reasoning with uncer tainty ab out the ordering of events is harder than the corresp onding planning problem  This hap p ens b ecause in the corresp onding planning problem the planner is free to select an arbitrary set of event instances from a xed set of eventtyp es with no restrictions on the ordering of event instancesIn most cases if the events are not under the planners control howev
er the problems are computationally equivalent Previous researchshows that the asso ci ated decision problems for temp oral reachability and planning are hard even for very restricted cases  	 Wehave b een trying to understand why temp oral reachability and planning are so dicult and what if any structure might b e extracted from such prob lems to exp edite decision making and inference  In this pap er wepresentaframework of lo calized temp oral reasoning Using this framework temp oral

reachability is viewed as search in the global search spaces asso ciated with individual problem instances The sizes of the global search spaces are determined by  the total numb er of the conditions inPand 	 the total numb er of the events inE Our inves tigations have fo cused on the notions of lo calityin time and the structure of the search spaces Lo cality in time in a particular problem instance is mo deled
by a hierarchyofregionsEach region is comp osed of an encapsulated event subset The events outside a regionRmust o ccur either b efore or after the events inRWe allows the child regions of a region to b e partially ordered Given a hierarchy of regions we can induce a set ofcoupling conditionsand a set of abstract conditionsfor each individual region which reect lo cality in the asso ciated search space and en able us to construct lo cal search spacesThe cou pling conditions of a regionRare the media for inter regional interactions b etween the events in di
erent child regions ofR The abstract conditions of a re gionRare the media for the interactions b etween the ev
ents in regionRand the events not inR Instead of search in the global search space we can search the lo cal search spaces and propagate the e
ects of lo cal search The sizes of the sets of coupling condi tions and the numb ers of child regions of individual regions determine the complexity for an instance of temp oral reachability This research utilizes the notions of lo calized plan ning  subgoals  and abstraction 	  to exp edite temp oral reasoning The use of event based lo calized reasoning in planning has b een ad vo cated by Lansky in GEM In GEM lo cality regarding domain b ehavior is also mo deled byre gions Regions in GEM are comp osed of sets of interrelated events whose b ehaviors are delimited by eventbased temp oral logic constraints The GEM PLAN planner utilizes lo calized planning to exploit lo calityby sub dividing the global search space into regional search spacesIn this pap er weidentify the corresp onding notion of regions in the temp oral reachability problem which mo dels lo cality in time In addition we study the dep endencies b etween con ditions and regions and identify the coupling con ditions and the abstract conditions asso ciated with individual regionsThese structures mo del lo cality in search spaces The statebased approach allows us to use knowledge regarding subgoals abstract events and lo cal search spaces to conduct and analyze lo cal ized reasoning in a clear and elegantway The useful
ness of subgoals macroop erators and abstraction in reducing the search e
ort in planning has b een inves tigated by Korf  We identify subgoals and abstract events as useful knowledge for temp oral reachability We develop techniques to derive this critical knowl edge from individual temp oral reachability instances Our techniques are di
erent from previous work on abstraction   inthat we transform encap sulated event subsets into abstract events instead of
transforming individual op erators into abstract op er ators The Temp oral Reachability Problem An instance of the temp oral reachability problem is dened byhPIGEOi Pis a set of conditions mo deling the world state Each condition inPhas a status true or false at a given p oint in time Iis a set of conditionstatus pairs that sp ecies the initial statuses of each condition inP Gis a set of conditionstatus pairs that sp ec ies the goal statuses of all or a subset of the conditions inP Eis a set of events each of whose causal ef fects are represented by a set of causal rules A causal ruleris a STRIPSlike op erator which describ es the status c
